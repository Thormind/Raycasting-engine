Some comments are in french.  The translation is in progress.
Some code is left in comment and needs to be cleaned
This is meant to be a solo exploration project. The code could be cleaner

This is still a work in progress. Currently i am working to add support for sprites.

What i would like to do afterward, in order of preference:
- Add textures for floor and ceiling
- Add some basic lighting effect
- Add support for different wall heights
- Add support for exterior scenes
